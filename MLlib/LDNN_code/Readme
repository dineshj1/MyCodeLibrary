This is an example code for LDNN classifier described in:

"Image Segmentation with Cascaded Hierarchical Models and Logistic Disjunctive
Normal Networks", ICCV 2013.

The source code and precompiled binaries for different platforms are available here.
-If you want to compile the mex files use “compile.m” script available in the package.
-We integrated the kmeans function of the berkley vision group for clustering.
-”LDNN_train.m” is the main function for training the classifier and “LDNN_predict.m” is the main function for testing the classifier.
-You can use “demo.m” to run some examples.
